# image-crawler

## Description

Write the website which will take an input as a webpage url and will output all the images from this webpage.

## Suggestions

- Use NodeJS with NPM.
- Use [`requestjs`](https://github.com/request/request) paired with [`expressjs`](http://expressjs.com/).
- Bonus if you will separate api and app/website.
- Do not spend much time on the frontend part of it, unless you want to. The primarily goal is build server/api.
